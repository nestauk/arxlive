    <h2>Welcome to arXlive</h2>
    <p>In the past two decades, it has become the norm for entirely new industries to
    arise in just a few years. Traditional means of monitoring industrial and academic
    activity are relatively slow, and this leads to laggy policy decisions - which means
    that the full benefits of these industries will not be distributed evenly. In
    response to this, we have developed <strong>arXlive</strong>.</p>
