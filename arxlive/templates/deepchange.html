<h2>Welcome to arXlive</h2>
<p>In the past two decades, it has become the norm for entirely new industries to
arise in just a few years. Traditional means of monitoring industrial and academic
activity are relatively slow, and this leads to laggy policy decisions - which means
that the full benefits of these industries will not be distributed evenly. In
response to this, we have developed <strong>arXlive</strong>.</p>
